<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>
<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Percex Technologies, LLC ("Percex," "we," "us," or "our") browser extension, website, and related services (collectively, the "Services"). By installing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>

<p>You must be at least 16 years old and capable of entering into a binding agreement to use the Services. By using the Services, you represent that you meet these requirements.</p>

<h2>2. License and Access</h2>
<p>Percex grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the Services for your personal or internal business use. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from the Services except as permitted by applicable law.</p>

<h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to use the Services to violate any law, infringe any rights, transmit malicious code, interfere with the operation of the Services, or access data that does not belong to you. Percex may suspend or terminate your access for any violation of these Terms.</p>

<h2>4. Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not collect personal data from this project. For additional details, review our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All rights, title, and interest in the Services, including software, text, graphics, and logos, remain the property of Percex or its licensors. These Terms do not grant you any ownership rights.</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Services may interact with third-party content or platforms. Percex is not responsible for third-party services, and your use of them is subject to their respective terms.</p>

<h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Percex disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>
<p>Percex may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without notice. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will continue in effect, including ownership, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnity.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms periodically. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Services after the changes take effect means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
