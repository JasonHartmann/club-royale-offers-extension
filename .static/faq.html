        <h2>How do I add a second profile and link them?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the offers page while signed into the first loyalty account and click <strong>Show All Offers</strong>. The extension saves that account as a profile tab automatically.</li>
          <li>Log out of the cruise site completely, sign into the second loyalty account, navigate to the offers page, and click <strong>Show All Offers</strong> again. A second profile tab appears.</li>
          <li>Click the <span class="material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">link</span> chain icon on both profile tabs to link them.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Combined Offers</strong> tab becomes enabled and shows the merged view of the two linked profiles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">Tip: To refresh a profile’s data later, redo the sign-out/sign-in flow for that account and click <strong>Show All Offers</strong> again.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>What is Offer Value and how is it used?</h2>
        <p><strong>Offer Value</strong> estimates the base cruise fare for the awarded category (dual occupancy) after subtracting taxes and fees. The Balcony and Suite upgrade columns use this value to estimate how much you would pay to move up to a higher category.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>How do the Balcony and Suite upgrade columns work?</h2>
        <p>Upgrade estimates are calculated using itinerary pricing and your offer’s base value. When taxes/fees are included, the upgrade shows the minimum total “You Pay” for the target category.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>Can I include or exclude taxes in price filters?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Open the <strong>Settings</strong> gear and toggle <strong>Include Taxes & Fees in Price Filters</strong>. This affects Advanced Search price fields and upgrade columns.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>How does the Back-to-Back (B2B) tool work and what do depths mean?</h2>
        <p>The B2B Builder reads the sailings that are already in your table, and labels each row with a <strong>depth</strong> number. That number is the longest uninterrupted chain of cruises you can sail starting with that offer using what you currently have.</p>
        <p>Side-by-side behavior is controlled by the <strong>Include Side-by-Sides</strong> setting (Settings gear). When enabled, the builder allows same-day connections across ships in the same port. When disabled, it prefers same-ship connections only.</p>
        <p>Click the depth pill to open the Back-to-Back Builder. Use <strong>Add to chain</strong> to build a sequence, then click <strong>Save Chain to Favorites</strong>. Saved chains show a chain ID badge in the Favorites tab.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>How do I search by upgrade price?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the <strong>Advanced Search</strong> drawer by clicking the button.</li>
          <li>Select one of the custom search criteria from "Interior Price", "Ocean View Price", "Balcony Price", or "Suite Price" in the "Add Field" drawer.</li>
          <li>Set the <strong>less than</strong> operator on the new filter.</li>
          <li>Type the max price you are willing to pay for the upgrade (e.g., <code>250</code> for $250).</li>
          <li>The filter applies instantly to the selected profile and respects whatever group or sort state you already have.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>What are itinerary links and what do they show?</h2>
        <p>Click a destination link to open the itinerary popup. It includes stateroom pricing, estimated “You Pay” amounts, and a day‑by‑day route summary.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>How do Favorites work?</h2>
        <p>Click the star icon on any row to save a sailing. Favorites appear in a dedicated tab and are stored locally in your browser.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>What does the B2B chain ID mean?</h2>
        <p>When you save a Back‑to‑Back chain, the Favorites tab shows a chain ID badge in the B2B column so you can identify the saved sequence.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>Can I hide groups I don’t care about?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Use the group menu in the table headers to hide entire groups. Hidden groups are removed from view until you unhide them.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-card">
        <h2>Why is the table slow and how can I speed it up?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the Hidden Groups feature to hide large sections of the table. To do this, open the group picker via the Yellow Folder icon in each column header and use the "Trashcan" icon to hide those groups. For the best results, hide groups with many rows that you know you can't use, such as "Code: 25TIER3".</li>
          <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> and toggle <strong>Auto-run Back-to-Back Builder Calculations</strong> to limit depth calculations for the B2B tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If performance stays rough, send your browser/OS combo to <a href="mailto:admin@comproyale.com">admin@comproyale.com</a> so we can look into it.</p>
