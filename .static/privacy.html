<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 25, 2026</p>
<p>Percex Technologies, LLC ("Percex," "we," "us," or "our") values your privacy. This policy describes how information is handled for our website, browser extension, and related services (collectively, the "Services").</p>

<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<p>The extension is designed to run locally on your device. We do not collect personal data or sell your information. Most settings and data remain on your device unless you choose to export them.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or transmit names, emails, browsing history, payment data, or account credentials through the extension.</p>

<h2>3. Information Stored Locally</h2>
<p>The extension may store preferences (such as settings, filters, and column visibility) and locally saved items (such as favorites) in your browser storage. This data stays on your device and is used only to provide features you enable.</p>

<h2>4. Exports and User Actions</h2>
<p>If you export data (for example, CSV downloads), those files are created locally in your browser. We do not receive copies of exported files.</p>

<h2>5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
<p>We do not use cookies or trackers in the extension. The Services do not collect telemetry or analytics from the extension.</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
<p>The Services may include links to third-party websites (for example, optional offer-code lookup or tip links). Your interactions with those sites are governed by their policies, not ours. Tips are optional and do not unlock features or content. App stores and browsers may collect information when you install or update extensions; please review their privacy policies.</p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<p>We design the Services to minimize data exposure by keeping processing local. No system is perfectly secure; please keep your device and browser up to date.</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Services are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the Services after changes become effective indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

<h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:lit@percex.com">lit@percex.com</a>.</p>
