<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>
<p>Percex Technologies, LLC ("Percex," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information for this project, including our website, browser extension, and related services (collectively, the "Services").</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or otherwise process any personal data from users of these Services. The extension operates entirely on your device and does not transmit personal information to Percex.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>Because we do not collect data, we do not use personal information for any purpose.</p>

<h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or share personal information because no personal information is collected.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<p>No personal data is retained. Any temporary information generated on your device remains local and is removed when you close or uninstall the extension.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>The Services are designed to work locally with minimal permissions, reducing exposure of your personal data. If you suspect unauthorized activity related to the extension, please contact us immediately.</p>

<h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
<p>You may uninstall or stop using the Services at any time. Since we do not collect data, there is nothing for you to request access to, correct, or delete.</p>

<h2>7. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
<p>The Services do not set cookies, use local storage for tracking, or collect telemetry.</p>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The Services are not directed to individuals under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because no data is collected, any inadvertent use still results in no personal data being sent to Percex.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

<h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please email us at <a href="mailto:lit@percex.com">lit@percex.com</a>.</p>
