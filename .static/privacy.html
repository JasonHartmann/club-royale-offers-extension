<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 23, 2025</p>
<p>Percex Technologies, LLC ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website or services (the "Service").</p>

<h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect your X username and user ID when you log in with your X account via OAuth. That’s it—no other personal data is gathered from X or elsewhere.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use It</h2>
<p>We use your X username and ID only to authenticate you and let you access the Service. We don’t store this info long-term—it’s held in memory during login and then discarded.</p>

<h2>3. Sharing Your Info</h2>
<p>We don’t share, sell, or give your data to anyone, except if required by law. No third parties get it.</p>

<h2>4. Security</h2>
<p>We use HTTPS to keep data safe in transit. Since we don’t store your info, there’s little risk on our end.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You can stop using the Service anytime. We don’t keep your data, so there’s nothing to delete. Questions? Reach out below.</p>

<h2>6. Cookies</h2>
<p>We don’t use cookies or tracking tech yet. If that changes, we’ll update this policy.</p>

<h2>7. Changes</h2>
<p>We might tweak this policy. Check back here for updates.</p>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>
<p>Email us at lit@percex.com with any privacy concerns.</p>
