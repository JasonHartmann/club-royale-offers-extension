This repository uses a canonical COPILOT instructions file located at `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

Please read and follow the guidance there. The `.github` copy is authoritative for repository-level assistant guidelines; any root-level copies should be treated as non-canonical and may be replaced with a pointer to the `.github` file.

If you need edits to repository guidance, update `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and call out the change in the PR description.
